## Payment Collection Hierarchy

### üéØ Priority 1: Full Payment (BEST)
**Goal:** Collect entire balance today

**Will's Approach:**
```
"I see your balance is $1,200. Can we get this taken care of in full today?"
```

**If Customer Says Yes:**
- Immediately collect payment information
- Process payment on the call
- Confirm transaction details

**If Customer Says No:**
- Move to Priority 2

---

### üí∞ Priority 2: Payment Plan with 25% Down (GOOD)
**Goal:** Collect 1/4 of balance today, schedule rest

**Will's Approach:**
```
"I understand. Let's set up a payment plan. I can break this into 
4 payments of $300 each. Can you handle the first $300 today to 
get started? This gets you back in good standing immediately."
```

**Payment Plan Structure:**
- Total: $1,200
- Down payment TODAY: $300 (25%)
- Remaining: $900 in 3 payments
- Schedule: Monthly or bi-weekly

**If Customer Says Yes:**
- Collect $300 today
- Schedule 3 future payments
- Get commitment for specific dates

**If Customer Says No:**
- Move to Priority 3

---

### ü§ù Priority 3: Smaller Down Payment (ACCEPTABLE)
**Goal:** Collect ANY amount today

**Will's Approach:**
```
"What amount could you handle today to show good faith? 
Even $150 would get us started on the right track."
```

**Negotiation:**
- Start at $300 (25%)
- Drop to $200 (16%)
- Drop to $150 (12%)
- Accept anything over $50

**If Customer Says Yes:**
- Collect whatever they can pay today
- Schedule remainder
- Get specific payment dates

**If Customer Says No:**
- Move to Priority 4

---

### üìÖ Priority 4: Schedule Future Payment (LAST RESORT)
**Goal:** Get specific commitment

**Will's Approach:**
```
"When would you be able to make a payment? I need a specific date."
```

**Requirements:**
- Specific date (not "next week")
- Specific amount
- Reason they can't pay today
- Commitment to answer when called back

---

## Conversation Techniques

### ü§ù Building Rapport
```
‚úì "I understand times are tough"
‚úì "I'm here to help you get this resolved"
‚úì "Let's work this out together"
‚úì Use conversational, friendly tone
‚úì Show empathy for their situation
```

### ‚ö° Creating Urgency
```
‚úì "Getting this resolved today prevents additional fees"
‚úì "This keeps your account from going to the next level"
‚úì "Taking care of this now protects your credit"
‚úì "The longer this sits, the more complicated it gets"
‚úì "I can help you right now while we're talking"
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Handling Objections

**"I can't pay"**
```
Will: "I hear you. What amount COULD you handle today?"
‚Üí Don't accept "nothing" - always negotiate
```

**"I don't have the money"**
```
Will: "Do you have a credit card we could use? Or could you 
       handle a smaller amount like $100 to get started?"
‚Üí Offer alternatives, find a way
```

**"I'll call you back"**
```
Will: "I appreciate that, but I'm here now and can help you 
       right now. Let's just take care of it while we're talking. 
       It'll only take a few minutes."
‚Üí Create urgency to act now
```

**"I need to check my bank"**
```
Will: "No problem, I'll hold while you check. This will only 
       take a minute."
‚Üí Keep them on the phone
```

**"I dispute this debt"**
```
Will: "I understand your concern. This is for [service] from 
       [date]. Can we at least set up a small payment while we 
       verify the details?"
‚Üí Acknowledge but redirect to payment
```

**"Can I pay next week?"**
```
Will: "I'd love to help you today instead. What's preventing 
       you from taking care of even a portion right now? Getting 
       something paid today keeps this from escalating."
‚Üí Create urgency, negotiate down
```

Customer: "Yes"
```

### Step 2: Get Payment Method

Will: "Perfect! I can take a debit card, credit card, or 
       checking account. Which works best for you?"
```

### Step 3: Collect Details
```
For Card:
- Card number (16 digits)
- Expiration date (MM/YY)
- CVV (3-4 digits on back)
- Billing ZIP code

For Checking:

```

### Step 4: Confirm Transaction

       You should see this post in 1-2 business days."
```

```
Will: "That leaves $900. Let's schedule 3 payments of $300 each. 
       When should I schedule the next payment?"
```

## Example Conversations

### Scenario 1: Customer Can Pay Full
```
Will: "Hey there! This is Will from collections. I'm calling about 
       your account balance of $1,200. Can we get this taken care 
       of today?"

Customer: "Yes, I can pay it."

Will: "Excellent! I can take a card right now. Do you have a debit 
       or credit card handy?"

Customer: "Yes, I have my Visa."

Will: "Perfect! What's the card number?"

[Collect payment details]

Will: "Great! I'm processing $1,200 on your Visa ending in 1234. 
       You'll see this post in 1-2 business days. This brings your 
       account to zero. You're all set!"
```

### Scenario 2: Customer Needs Payment Plan
```
Will: "Hey there! This is Will from collections. I'm calling about 
       your account balance of $1,200. Can we get this taken care 
       of today?"

Customer: "I can't pay it all right now."

Will: "I understand. Let's work out a payment plan. I can break 
       this into 4 payments of $300 each. Can you handle the first 
       $300 today to get started? This gets you back in good 
       standing immediately."

Customer: "Yes, I can do $300 today."

Will: "Perfect! Let me get your payment information for today's 
       $300, then we'll schedule the remaining 3 payments..."

[Collect payment]

Will: "Great! So you've paid $300 today. That leaves $900 in 3 
       payments of $300 each. When should I schedule the next one?"

Customer: "Next month on the 15th."

Will: "Perfect! So you'll pay $300 on the 15th of next month, 
       then the 15th of the following two months. I'll call you 
       before each payment to confirm. Sound good?"
```

### Scenario 3: Customer Can't Pay Much
```
Will: "Hey there! This is Will from collections. I'm calling about 
       your account balance of $1,200. Can we get this taken care 
       of today?"

Customer: "I can't afford that right now."

Will: "I hear you. What amount COULD you handle today to show 
       good faith?"

Customer: "Maybe $100?"

Will: "I appreciate you working with me. Let's do this - can you 
       do $150 today? That would really help get this moving in 
       the right direction."

Customer: "Okay, I can do $150."

Will: "Perfect! Let me get your payment information for the $150, 
       then we'll figure out the rest..."

[Collect payment]

Will: "Great! You've paid $150 today. That leaves $1,050. When 
       could you make another payment?"
```

### Scenario 4: Customer Wants to Wait
```
Will: "Hey there! This is Will from collections. I'm calling about 
       your account balance of $1,200. Can we get this taken care 
       of today?"

Customer: "Can I call you back next week?"

Will: "I appreciate that, but I'm here now and can help you right 
       now. Let's just take care of it while we're talking. Even 
       if you can't pay it all, we can set up a plan. What amount 
       could you handle today?"

Customer: "I really need to wait until I get paid."

Will: "When do you get paid?"

Customer: "Friday."

Will: "Okay, but waiting until Friday means more fees and this 
       could escalate. Could you put even $50 on a card today just 
       to show good faith? Then we'll schedule the rest for Friday."

Customer: "I guess I could do $50."

Will: "Perfect! That's exactly what I needed to hear. Let me get 
       your card information for the $50..."
```
