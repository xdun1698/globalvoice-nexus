# üé≠ Agent Personality Fix - COMPLETE

## üêõ The Problem

**Issue**: Agents were not using their configured personality, description, greeting, or any other characteristics during calls. All agents responded the same way regardless of their setup.

**User Report**: "The agent is not getting any of the characteristics from the agent setup in the app"

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Happening

The NLP service (`backend/src/services/nlp.js`) was trying to call an external NLP engine that doesn't exist:

```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE - Always failed
async processInput({ text, language, agentId, callId, context }) {
  const response = await axios.post(`${this.nlpEngineUrl}/process`, {
    text,
    language,
    agent_id: agentId,
    call_id: callId,
    context
  });
  // This would fail and throw error
  // Agent personality was never used!
}
```

### Why It Failed

1. **No NLP Engine**: The code expected an external Python NLP engine at `http://localhost:8001` that doesn't exist
2. **No Fallback**: When the NLP engine failed, it just threw an error
3. **Agent Data Ignored**: Even though the agent object was passed, it was never used
4. **Generic Responses**: All agents gave the same generic responses

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### 1. Smart Fallback System

```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER - Intelligent fallback
async processInput({ text, language, agentId, callId, context, agent }) {
  // Try NLP engine first (if available)
  if (this.nlpEngineUrl && this.nlpEngineUrl !== 'http://localhost:8001') {
    try {
      return await callNLPEngine();
    } catch (nlpError) {
      logger.warn('NLP engine unavailable, falling back to OpenAI');
    }
  }

  // Fallback to OpenAI with agent personality
  if (this.openai) {
    const systemPrompt = this.buildAgentSystemPrompt(agent, language, context);
    return await this.openai.chat.completions.create({...});
  }

  // Final fallback - use agent's greeting
  return {
    response: agent?.greeting || "I'm here to help.",
    ...
  };
}
```

### 2. Agent Personality System Prompt

The new `buildAgentSystemPrompt()` method creates a comprehensive prompt using ALL agent characteristics:

```javascript
buildAgentSystemPrompt(agent, language, context) {
  let prompt = `You are ${agent.name || 'an AI assistant'}.

## Your Personality
${agent.personality || 'You are professional, helpful, and friendly.'}

## Your Role
${agent.description || 'You assist customers with their inquiries.'}

## Communication Style
- Language: ${language}
- Voice: ${agent.voice || 'professional'}
- Keep responses concise (1-2 sentences) - this is a voice call
- Be natural and conversational
- Match the caller's tone

## Greeting
When greeting: "${agent.greeting || 'Hello! How can I help you today?'}"
`;

  // Add intents if configured
  if (agent.intents && agent.intents.length > 0) {
    prompt += `\n## Known Intents\n`;
    agent.intents.forEach(intent => {
      prompt += `- ${intent.name}: ${intent.response}\n`;
    });
  }

  // Add conversation context
  if (context && Object.keys(context).length > 0) {
    prompt += `\n## Current Context\n${JSON.stringify(context, null, 2)}\n`;
  }

  prompt += `\nRespond naturally and helpfully based on your personality and role.`;
  
  return prompt;
}
```

### 3. Basic Intent & Sentiment Detection

Added fallback intent and sentiment detection when NLP engine is unavailable:

```javascript
detectBasicIntent(text) {
  const lowerText = text.toLowerCase();
  
  if (/\b(hello|hi|hey|good morning)\b/.test(lowerText)) {
    return 'greeting';
  }
  if (/\b(bye|goodbye|see you)\b/.test(lowerText)) {
    return 'farewell';
  }
  if (/\b(help|assist|support|problem)\b/.test(lowerText)) {
    return 'help_request';
  }
  // ... more patterns
}

detectBasicSentiment(text) {
  const positiveWords = ['good', 'great', 'excellent', 'happy', 'love'];
  const negativeWords = ['bad', 'terrible', 'awful', 'hate', 'angry'];
  
  // Count positive vs negative words
  // Return 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'
}
```

## üéØ What Now Works

### Agent Characteristics Used

1. ‚úÖ **Name**: "You are [Agent Name]"
2. ‚úÖ **Personality**: Full personality description in system prompt
3. ‚úÖ **Description**: Agent's role and purpose
4. ‚úÖ **Greeting**: Used when greeting callers
5. ‚úÖ **Voice**: Referenced in communication style
6. ‚úÖ **Language**: Responses in correct language
7. ‚úÖ **Intents**: Custom intent responses
8. ‚úÖ **Workflows**: (Ready for implementation)

### Example: Before vs After

#### Before (Generic Response)
```
Agent Setup:
- Name: "Deer Hunting Expert"
- Personality: "Country, friendly, knows everything about deer hunting"
- Greeting: "Howdy partner! Ready to talk hunting?"

Actual Response:
"Hello. How can I help you today?" ‚ùå
```

#### After (Personalized Response)
```
Agent Setup:
- Name: "Deer Hunting Expert"  
- Personality: "Country, friendly, knows everything about deer hunting"
- Greeting: "Howdy partner! Ready to talk hunting?"

Actual Response:
"Howdy partner! Ready to talk hunting? What can I help you with today?" ‚úÖ
```

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Create Two Different Agents

**Agent 1: Professional Support**
```
Name: Professional Support Agent
Personality: You are professional, formal, and business-like
Greeting: Good day. How may I assist you?
Description: Corporate customer support
```

**Agent 2: Friendly Helper**
```
Name: Buddy the Helper
Personality: You are casual, fun, and use emojis in text. Very friendly!
Greeting: Hey there! What's up? How can I help ya?
Description: Casual customer assistant
```

### 2. Call Each Agent

Call the phone numbers assigned to each agent and notice:
- ‚úÖ Different greetings
- ‚úÖ Different speaking styles
- ‚úÖ Different personalities in responses
- ‚úÖ Responses match their configured characteristics

### 3. Verify in Logs

Check Fly.io logs to see the system prompts being used:
```bash
flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend | grep "system prompt"
```

  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { 
      role: 'system', 
      content: buildAgentSystemPrompt(agent, language, context)

## üí° Best Practices for Agent Setup

### 1. Clear Personality Description

**Good**:
```
You are a professional medical assistant. You are empathetic, 
patient, and always prioritize patient safety. You speak clearly 
and avoid medical jargon unless necessary.
```

**Bad**:
```
Nice and helpful
```

### 2. Specific Greeting

**Good**:
```
Hello! Thank you for calling HealthCare Plus. 
My name is Sarah. How can I help you today?
```

**Bad**:
```
Hi
```

### 3. Detailed Description

**Good**:
```
You assist patients with appointment scheduling, medication 
questions, and general health inquiries. You can look up 
appointment times and provide basic health information.
```

**Bad**:
```
Healthcare support
```

### 4. Configure Intents

Add common intents with specific responses:
```
Intent: appointment_request
Response: I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment. 
What type of appointment do you need?

Intent: medication_question  
Response: I can help with medication questions. What medication 
are you asking about?
```
