- **Name**: Tom - Collections Agent
- **Voice**: Tom (ElevenLabs ID: `N2lVS1w4EtoT3dr4eOWO`)
- **Fallback**: Polly.Matthew
- **Mode**: Development (Half-cost tokens)

### Development Mode Enabled ✅

**Cost Savings:**

3. **Updated Agent Configuration** (`bill-collector-config.json`)

### Test the Agent

**Call**: +1 (817) 541-7385

**Expected**:
- Tom's voice (professional, authoritative)
- Half-cost token usage
- Same quality as production
- Natural, human-like tone

### Cost Comparison

**Before (Production Mode):**
- 1000 calls × 100 chars avg = 100,000 characters
- Cost: ~$22/month (Creator tier)

**After (Development Mode):**
- 1000 calls × 100 chars avg = 100,000 characters
- Cost: ~$11/month (50% savings)

**Total Monthly Savings**: ~$11/month

### Switching Between Modes

**Enable Development Mode (Half-cost):**
```bash
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set ELEVENLABS_DEV_MODE="true" -a globalvoice-backend
```

**Disable Development Mode (Full quality):**
```bash
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set ELEVENLABS_DEV_MODE="false" -a globalvoice-backend
```

**Note**: Turbo v2.5 already provides excellent quality. Most users won't notice a difference.

### Verification

Check logs to confirm development mode:
```bash
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend | grep "DEVELOPMENT MODE"
```

Expected output:
```
ElevenLabs running in DEVELOPMENT MODE - using turbo model (half-cost tokens)
```
