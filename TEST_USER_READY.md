## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Login Fails with "Network Error"

**Cause**: Backend not deployed yet

**Solution**: Wait 10-15 minutes for deployment

**Check backend status**:
```bash
curl https://globalvoice-backend.onrender.com/health
```

### If Login Fails with "Invalid credentials"

**Cause**: Typo in email or password

**Solution**: Use exact credentials:
- Email: `test@globalvoice.com` (lowercase, no spaces)
- Password: `TestPass123!` (exact case, with exclamation)

### If Login Succeeds But Dashboard Errors

**Cause**: Backend environment variables not set

**Solution**: 
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Check `globalvoice-backend` service
3. Verify all environment variables are set
