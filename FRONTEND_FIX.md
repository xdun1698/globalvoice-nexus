# 🔧 Frontend UI Issues - FIXED

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Phone Numbers Not Showing
**Problem:** Phone numbers weren't appearing in the agents list.

**Root Cause:** The backend API wasn't including phone numbers in the response.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `backend/src/routes/agents.js` to include `phone_numbers` array
- Both `GET /api/agents` and `GET /api/agents/:id` now return phone numbers

**Status:** ✅ FIXED and deployed to Fly.io

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Can't Edit Agents (Form Empty)
**Problem:** When clicking "Edit" on an agent, the form was empty.

**Root Cause:** The `AgentBuilder.jsx` component was loading agent data but not populating the form fields. The `setValue` function from react-hook-form was missing.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `setValue` to the useForm destructuring
- Implemented proper form field population in the useEffect
- Now correctly loads: name, description, greeting, language, voice, personality, intents, workflows

**Status:** ✅ FIXED and deployed to Netlify

## 🐛 If You Still See Issues

### Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Chrome/Edge
Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
Select "Cached images and files"
Click "Clear data"

# Or hard refresh
Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any errors (red text)
4. Common issues:
   - CORS errors → Backend CORS config issue
   - 401 errors → Token expired, need to re-login
   - Network errors → Backend might be down

### Verify Backend is Running
```bash
curl https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### Check if Logged In
```bash
# In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('auth-storage')
# Should return a JSON string with token
```

## 📊 What Was Changed

### Backend Changes
**File:** `backend/src/routes/agents.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const agents = await db('agents')
    .where({ user_id: req.user.id })
    .orderBy('created_at', 'desc');
  res.json({ agents });
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const agents = await db('agents')
    .where({ user_id: req.user.id })
    .orderBy('created_at', 'desc');
  
  // Get phone numbers for each agent
  for (const agent of agents) {
    const phoneNumbers = await db('phone_numbers')
      .where({ agent_id: agent.id })
      .select('id', 'number', 'country_code', 'capabilities');
    agent.phone_numbers = phoneNumbers;
  }
  
  res.json({ agents });
});
```

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/AgentBuilder.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
const { register, handleSubmit, watch, formState: { errors } } = useForm({...});

useEffect(() => {
  if (isEditing) {
    const agent = await api.get(`/api/agents/${id}`);
    // setValue from react-hook-form would be used here
    // ❌ Form fields not populated!
  }
}, []);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { register, handleSubmit, watch, setValue, formState: { errors } } = useForm({...});

useEffect(() => {
  if (isEditing) {
    const agent = await api.get(`/api/agents/${id}`);
    // ✅ Properly populate all form fields
    setValue('name', agent.name || '');
    setValue('description', agent.description || '');
    setValue('greeting', agent.greeting || '');
    // ... etc for all fields
  }
}, [isEditing, id, navigate, setValue]);
```

## 💡 Tips

### To assign a phone number to an agent:
```bash
curl -X POST https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/api/agents/AGENT_ID/phone-number \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+18175417385"}'
```

### To check which agent has which phone:
```bash
curl https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/api/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.agents[] | {name: .name, phones: .phone_numbers}'
```
