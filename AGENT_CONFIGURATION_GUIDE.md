## üìù How to Configure an Agent

### 1. Agent Name
**What it does**: Defines who the agent is

**Example**:
```
Customer Support Agent
Sales Consultant Sarah
Tech Support Specialist Mike
```

**Best Practice**: Use a descriptive name that reflects the role

---

### 2. Personality (CRITICAL!)

**What it does**: Defines HOW the agent communicates

**Bad Example** ‚ùå:
```
Nice and helpful
```

**Good Example** ‚úÖ:
```
You are a warm, empathetic healthcare assistant. You speak slowly 
and clearly, always prioritizing patient safety and comfort. You're 
patient with elderly callers and never rush them. You use simple 
language and avoid medical jargon unless necessary. You're reassuring 
but professional, and you always verify understanding before moving on.
```

**Another Good Example** ‚úÖ:
```
You are an enthusiastic, energetic sales consultant. You're genuinely 
excited about helping customers find solutions. You ask thoughtful 
questions, listen actively, and recommend products that truly fit their 
needs. You're consultative, not pushy. You use positive language and 
build rapport quickly. You're knowledgeable but explain things in 
simple terms.
```

**Key Elements**:
- Tone (warm, professional, casual, energetic)
- Speaking style (slow, fast, clear, detailed)
- Approach (patient, efficient, thorough)
- Values (safety, honesty, helpfulness)
- Specific behaviors (never rush, always verify, ask questions)

---

### 3. Description

**What it does**: Defines WHAT the agent does

**Example**:
```
You assist customers with product questions, troubleshooting technical 
issues, and processing returns. You can look up order status, check 
inventory, and escalate complex issues to human agents when needed.
```

**Best Practice**: Be specific about capabilities and limitations

---

### 4. Greeting

**What it does**: First thing callers hear

**Bad Example** ‚ùå:
```
Hi
```

**Good Example** ‚úÖ:
```
Hello! Thank you for calling HealthCare Plus. My name is Sarah, 
and I'm here to help you today. What can I do for you?
```

**Best Practice**: 
- Include company name
- Include agent name
- Be welcoming
- Ask how you can help

---

### 5. Voice

**What it does**: Determines the actual voice used

**How to set**:
1. Go to Agent Builder
2. Find "Voice Type" dropdown
3. Select from available voices
4. Male voices: Matthew, Brian, Enrique, Hans, etc.
5. Female voices: Joanna, Amy, Conchita, Marlene, etc.

**Important**: The voice you select will now be used! (This was broken before)

---

### 6. Language

**What it does**: Primary language for responses

**Options**:
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- Arabic (ar)

---

### 7. Intents

**What they do**: Predefined responses for common questions

**How to configure**:

**Intent Name**: `product_inquiry`
**Examples**: 
```
what products do you have
tell me about your products
what do you sell
```
**Response**:
```
We offer three main product lines: Premium, Standard, and Basic. 
Which one would you like to learn more about?
```

**Why this matters**: When the AI detects these phrases, it will use your exact response
