## 🚀 Next Steps - Create Your First Agent

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key (Required for AI Responses)

```bash
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..." -a globalvoice-backend
```

**Why needed?** This enables intelligent AI responses during calls. Without it, calls will fail.

### Step 2: Run the Admin CLI

```bash
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project
node admin-cli.js setup
```

**This will:**
1. Create your user account
2. Set up your first AI agent
3. Assign your Twilio phone number (+18175417385)
4. Configure personality and voice

### Step 3: Test Your Agent

```bash
# Call your number
+1 (817) 541-7385

# Expected experience:
# 1. Agent greets you professionally
# 2. You speak naturally
# 3. AI responds intelligently
# 4. Conversation flows naturally
# 5. Say "goodbye" to end
```

### Step 4: Monitor and Iterate

```bash
# View logs
flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend

# Check dashboard
open https://globalvoice-nexus.netlify.app
```

## 🎯 Agent Configuration Best Practices

### 1. **Personality Design**

**Good:**
```
You are a professional and empathetic customer support agent. 
Listen carefully, ask clarifying questions, and provide helpful solutions. 
Maintain a warm, friendly tone while being efficient.
```

**Bad:**
```
Help customers.
```

### 2. **Greeting Messages**

**Good:**
```
Hello! Thank you for calling [Company Name]. 
My name is [Agent Name], and I'm here to help you today. 
How can I assist you?
```

**Bad:**
```
Hi.
```

### 3. **Intent Examples**

**Good:**
```json
{
  "name": "billing_inquiry",
  "examples": [
    "I have a question about my bill",
    "Why was I charged",
    "billing issue",
    "invoice question"
  ],
  "response": "I'd be happy to help with your billing question. Could you please provide your account number?"
}
```

## 💡 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Greeting
```
Caller: "Hello"
Agent: "Hello! Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?"
Caller: "I need help with my account"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help with your account. Could you tell me more about what you need?"
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Query
```
Caller: "I was charged twice for my subscription"
Agent: "I understand you were charged twice, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me help you resolve this. Could you provide your account email?"
```

### Scenario 3: Ending Call
```
Caller: "Thank you for your help"
Agent: "You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
Caller: "No, that's all"
Agent: "Great! Thank you for calling. Have a wonderful day!"
[Call ends]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not provided"

**Solution:**
```bash
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..." -a globalvoice-backend
```

### Issue: "No agent found for number"

**Solution:**
Run the admin CLI to assign the phone number:
```bash
node admin-cli.js setup
```

### Issue: Agent doesn't respond intelligently

**Check:**
1. OpenAI API key is set
2. API key has credits
3. Agent personality is configured
4. Check logs for errors

## 📊 Cost Management

### Current Setup (POC)
- Twilio: $1.15/month (phone) + usage
- OpenAI: Pay-as-you-go (~$2-5/month for testing)
- Infrastructure: Free tier
- **Total**: ~$5-10/month

### Tips to Minimize Costs
1. Use `gpt-4o-mini` instead of `gpt-4o` (10x cheaper)
2. Limit max_tokens to 150 for responses
3. Monitor usage daily
4. Set up billing alerts
5. Use caching for repeated queries
