---

## 🎯 Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project
./deploy-to-flyio.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check Fly.io CLI installation
2. Authenticate with Fly.io
3. Create app (if needed)
4. Set environment secrets
5. Deploy backend
6. Run health checks
7. Show deployment URL

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install Fly.io CLI (if not installed)
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# 2. Login to Fly.io
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl auth login

# 3. Deploy backend
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/backend
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl launch --no-deploy
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only

# 4. Deploy frontend to Netlify
cd ../frontend
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify dashboard
# Or use: netlify deploy --prod
```

**Time**: 20-30 minutes

## 🔍 What's NOT Working (And Why It's OK)

### Local Development Environment

**Issue**: Backend won't start locally
```
Error: Database connection failed
Reason: PostgreSQL not installed
```

**Why This Is OK**:
1. ✅ App is designed for cloud deployment
2. ✅ Local database not needed for production
3. ✅ Can develop directly in cloud (preview environments)
4. ✅ Installing PostgreSQL locally is optional

**If You Want Local Development**:
```bash
# Option A: Install PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15
createdb globalvoice
cd backend && npm run migrate

# Option B: Use Docker
# Install Docker Desktop first
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```
