2. **Expected flow**:
   - Call connects
   - Agent greets you
   - You can speak naturally
   - Agent responds with AI-generated answers
   - Call is recorded

3. **Check the dashboard**:
   - Go to Calls page
   - See your call record
   - View transcript
   - Listen to recording

### Test 2: Outbound Call (After inbound works)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Twilio credentials not provided"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify secrets are set
flyctl secrets list -a globalvoice-backend

# Should show:
# - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
# - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
# - TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER

# If missing, set them again
```

### Issue: Call connects but no audio

**Solution**:
1. Check webhook URLs are correct in Twilio console
2. Verify BACKEND_URL is set correctly
3. Check Fly.io logs for errors:
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend
   ```

### Issue: Agent doesn't respond intelligently

**Solution**:
1. Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set
2. Check agent's system prompt is clear
3. Review call transcript to see what's being sent/received

### Issue: "Number not verified" error

**Solution**:
- With trial account, you can only call verified numbers
- Verify your test numbers in Twilio console
- Or upgrade to paid account (no trial restrictions)

## üí° Cost-Saving Tips for POC

### 1. Use Trial Credit Wisely
- Twilio gives $15 free credit
- That's ~1,000 minutes of testing
- Don't upgrade until you need to

### 2. Keep Calls Short
- Test with 1-2 minute calls
- Focus on specific features
- Use transcripts instead of re-calling

### 3. Limit Phone Numbers
- Start with 1 number ($1.15/month)
- Add more only when needed

### 4. Use GPT-3.5 for Testing
- Much cheaper than GPT-4
- Good enough for POC
- Upgrade to GPT-4 for production

### 5. Delete Recordings After Testing
- Recordings are free for 30 days
- Delete old ones to save storage

### 6. Monitor Usage
- Check Twilio console daily
- Set up usage alerts
- Stop if costs exceed budget
