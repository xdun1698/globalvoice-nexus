# 🔧 Deployment Fix - File System Issues Resolved

**Date**: October 14, 2025, 10:20 PM  
**Issue**: App crashing on Fly.io due to file system permission errors  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Root Cause

The application was trying to create directories in read-only file system locations:
1. `/app/logs` - Logger trying to create log files
2. `/app/uploads` - Multer trying to create upload directory

**Why this happened**: Fly.io containers run as non-root user (nodejs:1001) and `/app` is read-only after build.

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Logger Fix (`backend/src/utils/logger.js`)

**Problem**: Winston logger tried to create `/app/logs` directory

**Solution**: 
- Only create log files in development
- Check for `FLY_APP_NAME` environment variable
- Wrap in try-catch for graceful degradation
- Use console-only logging in production

```javascript
// Add file transports only in development (not in production/Fly.io)
if (!isProduction && process.env.FLY_APP_NAME === undefined) {
  try {
    if (!fs.existsSync(logsDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(logsDir, { recursive: true });
    }
    // ... file transports
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Could not create logs directory, using console only');
  }
}
```

### 2. File Upload Fix (`backend/src/routes/contacts.js`)

**Problem**: Multer tried to create `/app/uploads` directory

**Solution**: Use memory storage (no disk access needed)

```javascript
// Use memory storage in production (no disk access needed)
const upload = multer({ 
  storage: multer.memoryStorage()
});
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Stop Current App
```bash
flyctl scale count 0 -a globalvoice-backend
```

### 2. Verify Fixes in Code
```bash
# Check logger
grep -A 5 "FLY_APP_NAME" backend/src/utils/logger.js

# Check multer
grep -A 2 "memoryStorage" backend/src/routes/contacts.js
```

### 3. Deploy with Fresh Build
```bash
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/backend

# Deploy without cache to ensure fresh build
flyctl deploy --remote-only --no-cache -a globalvoice-backend
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check logs
flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend

# Test health endpoint
curl https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/health
```

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### Before Fix:
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/logs'
Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/uploads'
```

### After Fix:
- Logs: Console only in production ✅
- Uploads: Memory storage (no disk) ✅
- No file system writes needed ✅

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

- [x] Logger fixed - no file system writes in production
- [x] Multer fixed - uses memory storage
- [x] No other `mkdirSync` calls in codebase
- [x] Code committed to git
- [x] App stopped on Fly.io
- [ ] Fresh deployment with --no-cache
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Logs show successful startup

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Startup Logs:
```
🚀 Starting GlobalVoice Nexus Backend...
✅ Dotenv loaded
✅ Dependencies loaded
⚠️  Twilio credentials not provided - telephony features disabled
⚠️  OpenAI API key not provided - AI features disabled
⚠️  Anthropic API key not provided
✅ Database initialized
✅ Redis initialization failed - continuing without cache
✅ WebSocket initialized
🚀 GlobalVoice Nexus Backend running on port 8080
```

### Health Check Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T03:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## 🛡️ Prevention for Future

### Best Practices Implemented:

1. **No File System Writes in Production**
   - Use console logging only
   - Use memory storage for uploads
   - Use cloud storage (S3/R2) for persistent files

2. **Environment Detection**
   - Check `NODE_ENV === 'production'`
   - Check `FLY_APP_NAME` environment variable
   - Graceful degradation with try-catch

3. **Container-Friendly Code**
   - Assume read-only file system
   - Use `/tmp` for temporary files if needed
   - Use environment variables for configuration

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `backend/src/utils/logger.js` - Fixed file logging
2. `backend/src/routes/contacts.js` - Fixed file uploads

**Commits**:
- `5fc587c` - Fix logger for Fly.io deployment
- `8638c25` - Fix file uploads for Fly.io
- `9497a09` - Use memory storage for uploads

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Deploy with fresh build**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   flyctl deploy --remote-only --no-cache -a globalvoice-backend
   ```

2. **Monitor logs**:
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a globalvoice-backend
   ```

3. **Test health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/health
   ```

4. **If successful, set up database**:
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-url" -a globalvoice-backend
   flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key" -a globalvoice-backend
   ```

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Fly.io runs containers as non-root** - `/app` is read-only
2. **Docker caching can hide fixes** - Use `--no-cache` when debugging
3. **Stateless is better** - Memory storage > disk storage for containers
4. **Graceful degradation** - App should work without optional features

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ App starts without crashes  
✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK  
✅ No permission errors in logs  
✅ Console logging works  
✅ File uploads work (in memory)  
✅ Ready for database connection  

---

**Status**: Ready for fresh deployment with `--no-cache` flag
