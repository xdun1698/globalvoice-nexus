# AgentsSimplified International Voices - FIXED ✅

## 📊 **Assessment Complete**

User reported that international voices were not showing as choices in the agents UI frontend.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Investigation:**

1. **AgentBuilder.jsx** ✅
   - File: `/agents/new` and `/agents/:id/edit` routes
   - Status: Already had international voices (60+)
   - Implementation: Disabled dropdown with test voices
   - Result: Working correctly

2. **AgentsSimplified.jsx** ❌
   - File: `/agents` main page (agent list)
   - Status: Using old API call to `/api/agents/voices/elevenlabs`
   - Fallback: Only 4 basic voices (antoni, rachel, josh, bella)
   - Result: **This was the issue!**

### **The Problem:**

The main agents page (`AgentsSimplified.jsx`) has two modals:
1. **Create Agent Modal** - Select voice when creating
2. **Edit Agent Modal** - Change voice for existing agent

Both modals were loading voices from an API call that fell back to only 4 basic voices, not the 60+ international voices.

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Updated AgentsSimplified.jsx:**

```javascript
const loadVoices = async () => {
  setLoadingVoices(true);
  try {
    // Use international test voices as placeholders
    setVoices([
      // 60+ international voices with flag emojis
      { voice_id: 'test_antoni', name: '🇺🇸 Antoni (Male, US) - Professional, Clear' },
      { voice_id: 'test_priya', name: '🇮🇳 Priya (Female, Indian) - Clear, Professional' },
      // ... etc
    ]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load voices:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoadingVoices(false);
  }
};
```
