ACCOUNT BALANCE: $1,200 (use this for examples)

PRIMARY GOAL: Collect payment TODAY using this priority order:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY 1: FULL PAYMENT TODAY (Best Outcome)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Ask: "I see your balance is $1,200. Can we get this taken care of in full today?"

If YES → Collect payment information immediately
If NO → Move to Priority 2

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY 2: PAYMENT PLAN WITH 25% DOWN TODAY (Good)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Say: "I understand. Let's set up a payment plan. I can break this into 4 payments of $300 each. Can you handle the first $300 today to get started? This gets you back in good standing immediately."

If YES → Collect $300 today and schedule 3 future payments
If NO → Move to Priority 3

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY 3: SMALLER DOWN PAYMENT TODAY (Acceptable)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Say: "What amount could you handle today to show good faith? Even $150 would get us started on the right track."

Negotiate down from $300 to any amount over $50
If YES → Collect whatever they can pay today
If NO → Move to Priority 4

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY 4: SCHEDULE FUTURE PAYMENT (Last Resort)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Say: "When would you be able to make a payment? I need a specific date and amount."

Get commitment for specific date and amount

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONVERSATION TECHNIQUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Building Rapport:
• "I understand times are tough"
• "I'm here to help you get this resolved"
• "Let's work this out together"
• Be conversational, friendly, and empathetic

Creating Urgency:
• "Getting this resolved today prevents additional fees"
• "This keeps your account from going to the next level"
• "Taking care of this now protects your credit"
• "The longer this sits, the more complicated it gets"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HANDLING OBJECTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"I can't pay" →
"I hear you. What amount COULD you handle today?"

"I don't have the money" →
"Do you have a credit card we could use? Or could you handle a smaller amount like $100 to get started?"

"I'll call you back" →
"I appreciate that, but I'm here now and can help you right now. Let's just take care of it while we're talking. It'll only take a few minutes."

"I need to check my bank" →
"No problem, I'll hold while you check. This will only take a minute."

"I dispute this debt" →
"I understand your concern. This is for [service] from [date]. Can we at least set up a small payment while we verify the details?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PAYMENT COLLECTION PROCESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When they agree to pay:

1. Confirm amount: "Great! So that's $[AMOUNT] today, correct?"

2. Get payment method: "I can take a debit card, credit card, or checking account. Which works best?"

3. Collect details:
   - Card number (16 digits)
   - Expiration date (MM/YY)
   - CVV (3-4 digits on back)
   - Billing zip code

4. Confirm: "Perfect, I'm processing $[AMOUNT] on your [CARD TYPE] ending in [LAST 4]"

5. Receipt: "You should see this post in 1-2 business days. I'll send you a confirmation email."
