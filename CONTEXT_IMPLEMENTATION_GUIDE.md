# ðŸš€ Agent Context Implementation Guide

## What We Just Added

### âœ… New Database Tables
1. **conversation_history** - Tracks every turn in conversations
2. **call_sessions** - Manages current call state
3. **customer_profiles** - Stores customer information and behavior
4. **knowledge_base** - Stores business knowledge for RAG
5. **call_insights** - AI-generated insights after calls

### âœ… New Services
1. **ContextManager** - Centralized context management
2. **Enhanced NLP Service** - Now uses full context for responses

### âœ… Enhanced Agent Configuration
- `system_prompt` - Custom instructions for each agent
- `context_window` - How many conversation turns to remember
- `business_rules` - Rules the agent must follow
- `conversation_style` - professional, casual, technical
- `special_instructions` - Additional guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Deploy These Changes

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/backend

# Run the migration
npx knex migrate:latest --env production
```

**Or deploy to Fly.io and it will auto-migrate:**

```bash
cd /Users/dduncan/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/backend
/Users/dduncan/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy --remote-only -a globalvoice-backend
```

### Step 2: Update Your Agents

You can now enhance your agents with:

```javascript
// Example: Update agent with context configuration
const agentUpdate = {
  system_prompt: `You are a professional customer support agent for [Your Company].
  
Your role is to:
- Help customers with billing questions
- Resolve technical issues
- Provide product information
- Schedule callbacks when needed

Always be empathetic, professional, and solution-oriented.`,
  
  context_window: 10, // Remember last 10 conversation turns
  
  business_rules: [
    "Always verify customer identity before discussing account details",
    "Offer refunds only for amounts under $50",
    "Escalate to supervisor if customer is angry or issue is complex",
    "Always end calls by asking if there's anything else you can help with"
  ],
  
  conversation_style: "professional", // or "casual", "technical"
  
  special_instructions: "If customer mentions competitor, acknowledge but focus on our unique value proposition"
};

// Update via API
await fetch('https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/api/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(agentUpdate)
});
```

### Step 3: Add Knowledge Base Content

```javascript
// Example: Add knowledge to your agent
const knowledge = {
  category: "billing",
  title: "How to Update Payment Method",
  content: `To update your payment method:
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Settings > Billing
3. Click "Update Payment Method"
4. Enter new card details
5. Click Save

Note: Changes take effect immediately for future charges.`,
  tags: ["billing", "payment", "account"],
  language: "en",
  priority: 1 // Higher priority = more likely to be retrieved
};

await fetch('https://globalvoice-backend.fly.dev/api/knowledge', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(knowledge)
});
```

## ðŸ“Š How Context Works Now

### Before (Old System):
```
Customer: "I have a question about my bill"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help with that. What's your question?"
```

**Context Used:** None - Agent has no memory

### After (New System):
```
Customer: "I have a question about my bill"

Context Retrieved:
- Customer name: John Doe
- Last called: 3 days ago about same issue
- Previous sentiment: Frustrated
- Communication style: Direct, wants quick answers
- Relevant knowledge: "Billing FAQ", "Payment Methods"

Agent: "Hi John, I see you called about billing on Monday. 
I'm sorry we didn't fully resolve that. Let me help you now. 
What specific charge are you asking about?"
```

**Context Used:** Customer history, conversation history, knowledge base, business rules

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens During a Call

### 1. Call Starts
```javascript
// System automatically:
- Creates call_session
- Loads customer_profile (or creates new one)
- Retrieves last 3 calls
- Loads agent configuration
```

### 2. Customer Speaks
```javascript
// For each message:
1. Add to conversation_history
2. Detect intent and sentiment
3. Retrieve relevant knowledge
4. Build comprehensive context
5. Generate response with full context
6. Update session state
```

### 3. Call Ends
```javascript
// System automatically:
- Generates call summary
- Extracts key insights
- Updates customer profile
- Saves call_insights
- Updates customer statistics
```

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Wins You Can Implement Today

### 1. Personalized Greetings

**Before:**
```
"Hello, how can I help you today?"
```

**After:**
```javascript
// In your agent's system_prompt:
"If this is a returning customer, greet them by name and reference their last interaction.
Example: 'Hi Sarah! Good to hear from you again. Last time we helped you with X. What can I do for you today?'"
```

### 2. Context-Aware Responses

**Before:**
```
Customer: "It's still not working"
Agent: "What's not working?"
```

**After:**
```javascript
// System automatically knows:
- What "it" refers to (from conversation history)
- What they tried before (from previous calls)
- Their frustration level (from sentiment)

Agent: "I understand the payment issue is still happening. 
Let me try a different solution this time."
```

### 3. Proactive Support

**Before:**
```
Agent waits for customer to explain everything
```

**After:**
```javascript
// In your agent's business_rules:
[
  "If customer has called 3+ times about same issue, proactively offer escalation",
  "If customer mentions cancellation, immediately offer retention discount",
  "If customer's sentiment is negative, acknowledge frustration first"
]
```

```
You: "How do I update my payment method?"
Agent: [Should provide step-by-step instructions from knowledge base]
```

### Test 3: Business Rules Test
```
You: "I want to cancel my account"
Agent: [Should follow business rule to offer retention discount]
```
