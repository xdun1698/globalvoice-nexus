**Try These Conversation Flows:**

**Example 1: Basic Inquiry**
```
You: "Hi, who is this?"
Will: "Hey there! This is Will from the collections department. 
       I'm reaching out about your account. Is now a good time?"

You: "What account are you talking about?"
Will: "I'm calling about your outstanding balance. I wanted to 
       see if we could work out a payment arrangement that works 
       for you. What would be comfortable for your budget?"

You: "I can't pay right now."
Will: "I totally understand - times can be tough. Let's talk about 
       what might work. Could you handle a smaller payment to get 
       started, maybe spread it out over a few months?"
```

**Example 2: Interruption Handling**
```
You: "Wait, I need to check something..."
Will: "No problem, take your time. I'm here when you're ready."

You: "Okay, I'm back. What were you saying?"
Will: "I was asking if we could set up a payment plan that works 
       with your budget. What amount would be manageable for you?"
```

**Example 3: Questions**
```
You: "How much do I owe?"
Will: "Let me check that for you... [responds with account details]"

You: "Can I pay half now and half later?"
Will: "Absolutely! That's a great solution. When would you be able 
       to make the second payment?"
```
